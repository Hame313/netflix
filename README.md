# netflix

A netflix clone built with sass and vanilla javascript, used a tmdb api,

With a front page that plays a video, a search with an input that displays the query of results,
3 buttons where the first one displays the image and the overview of the movie,
second button is the like button, that saves the id of the movie in local storage,
and the last button saves the url of the image and the title into local storage then gets
displayed in the slider in the mylist file.
